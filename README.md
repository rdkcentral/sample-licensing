This repository contains sample files for use in RDK licensing.  The files are:

LICENSE
This file gives the text of all licenses used in the code.  (If the code is licensed as LGPL,
there should be a separate file called COPYING.LGPL which contains the full text of the LGPL
license only.)
It is recommended that <YEAR> and <AUTHOR> fields stay as shown, so that multiple attributions
to the same license need only one copy of the license text.  Some users prefer to personalise
these two fields (or <COPYRIGHT HOLDERS> as used in some licenses).  If doing this, the license
text will need to be repeated for each set of contributors.

COPYING
This is a soft link to the LICENSE file.

NOTICE
The NOTICE file gives credit to authors and indicates what license applies.
Other forms are possible depending on individual cases.

CONTRIBUTING.md
Please include the text as given.
